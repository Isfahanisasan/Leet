Clearly define all the populations with a formal title (e.g. Full Analysis, Per Protocol, Safety) and give criteria to determine if a subject or observational unit belongs to that population. The criteria typically relate to adherence to protocol and the taking of observations, which relate to missing data (section 6.4).<br><br>A note on terminology: Pharmaceutical companies generally adhere to the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) guidelines which use the term Full Analysis Set instead of Intention to Treat (ITT) population. In academia, the term ITT is more generally used. In ICH E9 “Statistical Principles for Clinical Trials,” the Full Analysis Set is identical to the Intention-to-Treat (ITT) Population: “The intention-to-treat (see Glossary) principle implies that the primary analysis should include all randomized subjects. … In practice this ideal may be difficult to achieve, … the term ‘full analysis set’ is used to describe the analysis set which is as complete as possible and as close as possible to the intention-to-treat ideal of including all randomized subjects.” Also, the distinction between (pure) ITT and modified ITT should be made when defining the study population. Most will define ITT as all randomized subjects, while modifications of the ITT principle exclude subjects who are never treated or who do not have post-treatment values.&nbsp;<br><br>It is not enough just to use a standard label for population.

The time to the first value\n&gt;1.5 mg/dL (when the value is initially &gt;1.5 and then declines to ≤1.5,\nthe time to the first value &gt;1.5 mg/dL after the decline will be used), to\ntransplant or to death will be considered time to failure of the procedure. The\ntwo groups will then be compared by a Cox regression model fitted to the time\nto failure.”<br><br>Section 5.B Data Analysis:<br><b>“Aim 1: To determine whether corticosteroid therapy decreases serum bilirubin concentration after portoenterostomy.<br></b><br><b>Hypothesis 1b:</b>&nbsp;Improved bile drainage (as defined by a serum total bilirubin level &lt;1.5 mg/dL) will remain for a longer period in infants treated with corticosteroids than in those treated with placebo.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Using the same definition of good bile drainage as in the primary hypothesis, the duration of time with good bile drainage (time to onset of poor bile drainage, transplant or death, whichever comes first) will be modeled by Cox proportional hazards model using the same model as above. If there is a statistically significant difference, the profiles of the bilirubin for the two treatment groups will be compared and 95% confidence limits will be computed.”<br><br>SAP:<br><b>Secondary Endpoint.&nbsp;</b>The duration of improved bile drainage will be defined as the time from a subject’s first total bilirubin is &lt;1.5 mg/dL to the earlier of his/her first total bilirubin value &gt;1.5 mg/dL, liver transplantation or death. The date of the first bilirubin value &gt; 1.5 mg/dL, liver transplantation or death is the failure date. &nbsp;Lost-to-follow-up, withdrawal, and study completion without experiencing the event are censoring events. If a subject is missing total bilirubin values during the study, then duration of good bile drainage is censored at the date of the last known value &lt;1.5 mg/dL for subjects who do not have subsequent liver transplantation or death. If a subject never achieves good bile drainage (i.e., total bilirubin &gt;1.5 mg/dL for the duration of the study), then duration is set to 0. Time will be defined as duration of good bile drainage in months; it is not defined as the time from HPE.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>"
